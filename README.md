# Effects of prophylactic and therapeutic AMU

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/177768619.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/177768619)

In this study we have two separate analyses.

The [first one](https://viparc.github.io/prophylactic/prophylactic.html) looks
at the effect of prophylactic AMU of the incidence of clinical signs. The
[second one](https://viparc.github.io/prophylactic/therapeutic.html) looks at
the effect of therapeutic AMU on the mortality rate.

The two analyses use
[surveillance data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/prophylactic/master/data/viparc_qualitative.csv) as well as a
[definition of antibiotics' classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/clires_data/master/data/antimicrobial_classes.csv)
