## Sketch out of the analysis

As for the analysis of the
[prophylactic AMU](https://viparc.github.io/prophylactic/prophylactic.html), the
main difficulty here consists in rearranging the data. Once the data is properly
rearranged, then the analysis is pretty classical. In this section we sketch out
the rationale of our analysis.

Because we are interested in therapeutic AMU, we will consider in this analysis
only weeks that are from **disease episodes**. A first challenge will thus
consist in characterizing disease episodes in terms of a set of clinical signs
and also in terms of `gap` (see the functions `fill_gaps()` and
`split_by_disease_episode()` below), as explained in **Figure 1** below.

<div style="text-align:center"> <img src="fig therapeutic 1.png" width="600"/> </div>

**Figure 1: Defining a disease episode.** The arrow represents the weeks (each
rectangle is a week) of a flock, from the first week on the left ot the last one
on the right. The red dots represent the presence of disease, as defined by a
set of clinical signs (where here we consider there is disease if at least one
of the clinical signs of the set is reported). In order to account for the fact
that symptoms may not be always reported, we want to allow the possibility to
convert one or a few weeks without reported symptoms and surrounded by weeks
with reported symptoms into one single disease episode. The parameter `gap` is
the number of week(s) without symptoms we allow ourself to skip when defining a
disease episode. Below the arrow are 3 examples of disease episodes definitions
with 3 episodes when `gap = 0`, 2 episodes when `gap = 1` and 1 episode only
when `gap = 3`.

Once this is done, the next step consists in splitting each disease episode into
2 periods: one before AMU (defined by a set of antimicrobials) and one after AMU
(**Figure 2**). Same as for the symptoms: here we consider there is AMU if at
least one of the drugs set that we consider is reported. The exact week where
AMU starts is excluded from the analysis because for this particular week it's
impossible to infer any form of causality. For some disease episodes there might
be no AMU at all. On the contrary, for some other disease episodes, there might
be AMU from the beginning of the episode. In those cases, we will have only a
`before` or an `after` period. Also, because we really want to ascertain that
our AMU can be considered as therapeutic, will exclude from the analysis all the
disease episodes that had AMU during the `x` weeks before the start of the
episode. This is what is done by the function `exclude_if_amu_before()` defined
below.

<div style="text-align:center"> <img src="fig therapeutic 2.png" width="600"/> </div>

**Figure 2: Separating the weeks before from the weeks after AMU in all disease episode.**
In this example, the arrows show the first 2 and the last flocks of our data.
Each flock starts on the left end and ends on the right end of the arrow and the
length of the arrow is the duration of the flock. Colored sections represent
disease episodes as identified in Figure 1. The red rectangles represent the
first week of AMU in the disease episodes. Sometimes there is no AMU at all
during the disease episode (as on the third episode of the first flock) and some
other times the firt week of AMU is the first week of the episode as on the
second episode of the second flock or the first episode of the last flock. Once
these first weeks of AMU are identified in all the disease episodes, we gather,
from all the disease episodes of all the flocks, all the weeks that occur before
(in blue) and all the weeks that occur after (in green) these first weeks of
AMU, making 2 arms: "before" and "after".

Once this is done, we end up with two arms of weeks: one `before` and one `after`
AMU (**Figure 2**). We can then estimate and compare the mortality rates in
these two arms with a logistic regression as detailed below. The great advantage
of a logistic regression is that it allows to include covariables in order to
control for potential confounding effects. For the purpose of the examples
below, we will use the following sets of clinical signs to define disease
episodes:

```{r}
cs_set <- c("malaise", "diarrhoea")
```

with this value of `gap`:

```{r}
gap <- 1
```

and the following set of antimicrobials to defined AMU:

```{r}
am_set <- c("colistin_use", "oxytetracycline_use")
```

and the following value of `x`:

```{r}
x <- 1
```

but the function `prepare_data()` at the end is a pipeline that puts everything
together, with `cs_set`, `am_set`, `gap` and `x` as tuning parameters. The last
section shows the different ways (basically with and without correcting for
potential condounding effects) to performed the statistical analysis. The user
can thus prepare a number of different data sets, depending on the values of the
`cs_set`, `am_set`, `gap` and `x` arguments and, on each of these data sets, 
perform a number of analyses depending on whether (s)he wants to correct for
potential confounding effects, and which ones.

## Packages

Installing the required packages:

```{r}
required <- c("dplyr", "magrittr", "purrr", "readr")
to_install <- setdiff(required, row.names(installed.packages()))
if (length(to_install)) install.packages(to_install)
```

Loading `magrittr` for interactive use:

```{r}
library(magrittr)
```

## Loading the data

```{r eval = FALSE}
viparc <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/prophylactic/master/data/viparc_qualitative.csv",
                          col_types = paste(c("ciiiddd", rep("l", 51)), collapse = ""))
```

```{r include = FALSE}
viparc <- readr::read_csv("data/viparc_qualitative.csv",
                          col_types = paste(c("ciiiddd", rep("l", 51)), collapse = ""))
```

We have 4 types of variables in this data frame:

* week ID with the variables `farm`, `flock` and `week`;
* chicken demography data with the variables `nb_chicken`, `nb_chicken_sold`,
  `chicken_disease_death` and `chicken_sudden_death`;
* presence of clinical signs with the variables `respiratory`, `diarrhoea`,
  `cns`, `malaise`, `leg_lesions` and `sudden_death`;
* AMU (presence / absence too) with the `r ncol(viparc) - 12` variables
  `amoxicillin_use` to `unknown_use`.

## Preparing the data

The function `fill_gaps()` takes a vector of logicals (or zeros and ones) and
replaces all the `1 0 1` sequences by `1 1 1` (when `gap = 1`), or all `1 0 0 1`
sequences by `1 1 1 1` (when `gap = 2`), etc...:

```{r}
fill_gaps_0 <- function(x, gap) {
  as.integer(x) %>%         # because easier to deal with 1-character encoding
    paste(collapse = "") %>% 
    gsub(paste(c(1, rep(0, gap), 1), collapse = ""),
         paste(rep(1, gap + 2), collapse = ""), .) %>% 
    gsub("NA", "x", .) %>%  # need to replace potential NA by 1-character...
    strsplit("") %>%        # ... because of the strsplit() call that follows
    unlist(FALSE) %>%       # because strsplit() returns a list
    sub("x", NA, .) %>%     # back to NA
    as.numeric() %>% 
    as.logical()
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
fill_gaps_0(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), 2)
```

Works fine but it doesn't replace the gaps that are shorter than the `gap`
argument:

```{r}
fill_gaps_0(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), 2)
```

`fill_gaps()` is a wrapper around `fill_gaps_0()` that fixes this problem:

```{r}
fill_gaps <- function(x, gap) {
  while(gap > 0) {
    x <- fill_gaps_0(x, gap)
    gap <- gap - 1
  }
  x
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
fill_gaps(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), 2)
```

and:

```{r}
fill_gaps(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), 2)
```

The function `episodes()` identifies the different disease episodes. It would
for example transform `1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0` into `1 1 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 3 0`:

```{r}
episodes <- function(x) {
  x <- rle(x)
  sel <- which(x$values > 0)
  x$values[sel] <- seq_along(sel)
  inverse.rle(x)
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
episodes(c(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0))
```

The function `split_by_disease_episode()` uses the function `episodes()` to
generate, **for a given flock**, disease episodes according to a set of clinical
signs `cs`, and splits by row the data frame into a list of data frames, each
corresponding to a disease episode:

```{r}
split_by_disease_episode <- function(df, cs, gap) {
  if (any(unique(diff(df$week))) != 1) return(NULL) # makes sure there is no missing week
  df %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(disease = dplyr::select(., !! cs) %>%
                              rowSums() %>%
                              as.logical() %>%
                              fill_gaps(gap) %>% 
                              as.integer() %>%
                              episodes()) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(disease > 0) %>% 
    split(., .$disease) %>% 
    lapply(dplyr::select, -disease)
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
viparc %>% 
  dplyr::filter(farm == "75-004", flock == 1) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(week) %>% 
  split_by_disease_episode(cs_set, gap) %>% 
  lapply(dplyr::select, farm, flock, week, !! cs_set) # for simpler printing
```

Works for one given cycle. Here is how we make it works for all cycles:

```{r}
a <- viparc %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(week) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(farm, flock) %>% 
  dplyr::group_map(~ split_by_disease_episode(.x, cs_set, gap), keep = TRUE) %>% 
  unlist(FALSE)
```

which gives:

```{r}
a %>% 
  lapply(dplyr::select, farm, flock, week, !! cs_set) %>%
  head()
```

Before we continue, we want to exclude from this list all the disease episodes
with AMU during the $x$ weeks before the start of the episode, AMU being, again,
defined by a set of antimicrobials.

```{r}
exclude_if_amu_before <- function(df, x, df_ref, ab) {
  require(magrittr)
  am <- ab
  first_week <- min(df$week)
  if (first_week == 1) return(df)
  weeks <- (first_week - x):(first_week - 1)
  weeks <- weeks[weeks > 0]
  amu_before_episode <- df_ref %>% 
    dplyr::filter(farm == df$farm[1], flock == df$flock[1], week %in% weeks) %>% 
    dplyr::select({{ am }}) %>% 
    rowSums() %>% 
    as.logical() %>% 
    any()
  if (amu_before_episode) return(NULL)
  df
}
```

where `df` is a sub data frame of the `viparc` data frame, `x` is the duration,
in weeks, of the period before the start of the disease episode we consider to
filter out according to AMU, `df_ref` is typically the `viparc` data frame, and
`ab` is a set of antimicrobials used to define AMU. Let's try it:

```{r}
exclude_if_amu_before(a[[1]], 2, viparc, am_set)
```

The function `before_after()` below splits the data frame of a disease episode
into 2 data frames, one before the use of AMU and one after the use of AMU. The
week where AMU starts is deleted. AMU is defined in terms of a set of
antimicrobials.

```{r}
before_after <- function(df, ab) {
  require(magrittr)
  am <- ab
  start <- df %>%
    dplyr::select({{ am }}) %>%
    rowSums() %>%
    as.logical() %>%
    which() %>%
    head(1)
  if (length(start) < 1) return(list(df, NULL)) # there is never AMU
  if (start < 2) return(list(NULL, df[-1, ])) # AMU starts on the first week
  nr <- nrow(df)
  if (start == nr) return(list(df[-nr, ], NULL)) # AMU starts on the last week
  list(df[1:(start - 1), ], df[(start + 1):nr, ])
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
b <- lapply(a, before_after, am_set)
```

A pipeline that assembles the above defined `split_by_disease_episode()`,
`exclude_if_amu_before()` and `before_after()` functions in order to prepare the
data for analysis:

```{r}
prepare_data <- function(df, cs = NULL, am = NULL, gap = 1, x = 1) {
  require(magrittr)
  var_names <- setdiff(names(df), c("arm", "farm", "flock", "week", "nb_chicken",
                                    "nb_chicken_sold", "chicken_disease_death",
                                    "chicekn_sudden_death"))
  if (is.null(cs)) cs <- grep("_use$", var_names, value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
  if (is.null(am)) am <- grep("_use$", var_names, value = TRUE)
  df %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(week) %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(farm, flock) %>% 
    dplyr::group_map(~ split_by_disease_episode(.x, cs, gap), keep = TRUE) %>% 
    unlist(FALSE) %>%
    lapply(exclude_if_amu_before, x, viparc, am) %>% 
    purrr::compact() %>% # because exclude_if_amu_before() potentially generates NULL elements
    lapply(before_after, am_set) %>% 
    purrr::transpose() %>%
    lapply(purrr::compact) %>% # because before_after() potentially generates NULL elements
    setNames(c("before", "after")) %>% 
    lapply(dplyr::bind_rows) %>% 
    dplyr::bind_rows(.id = "arm") %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(arm = factor(arm, c("before", "after")),
                  suc = chicken_disease_death + chicken_sudden_death,
                  fai = nb_chicken + nb_chicken_sold)
}
```

Let's try it (takes a few seconds to run):

```{r}
viparc2 <- prepare_data(viparc,
                        c("malaise", "diarrhoea"),
                        c("colistin_use", "oxytetracycline_use"), 1, 2)
```

In this particular case, it produces the following numbers of weeks in the two
arms:

```{r}
table(viparc2$arm)
```

## Comparing mortality rates

Once the data is properly put in shape, the actual statistical analysis is quite
classical. Here, we consider a logistic regression:

```{r}
(mod <- glm(cbind(suc, fai) ~ arm, binomial, viparc2))
```

Note that, in this model, if you wish to correct for potential counfounding
effects such as chicken age or the use of other antimicrobials or the presence
of other clinical signs or AMU during the first stages of the flock, you will
have to include the corresponding variables in the formula of the model, making
sure that the `arm` variable is the last one. You can explore the model summary:

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

After AMU, the odds of dying is multiplied by the following factor:

```{r}
unname(exp(tail(coef(mod), 1)))
```

with the following confidence interval:

```{r}
mod %>% 
  confint() %>% 
  `[`(., nrow(.), ) %>% 
  exp()
```

The significativity of the therapeutic AMU is:

```{r}
anova(mod, test = "LRT")
```

### Estimating the mortality rate (in absence of covariables)

In absence of any covariable (age of the flock, etc...), you can also compute
the death rates for the two arms (`before` and `after`) straightforwardly thanks
to the following function:

```{r}
death_rate <- function(m) {
  require(magrittr)
  m %>% 
    predict.glm(se.fit = TRUE) %>% 
    lapply(unique) %>%
    head(2) %>% 
    purrr::transpose() %>% 
    lapply(function(x) c(x$fit, x$fit + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * x$se.fit)) %>% 
    lapply(m$family$linkinv) %>% 
    setNames(c("before", "after")) %>% 
    lapply(function(x) setNames(as.data.frame(t(x)), c("estimate", "lower", "upper"))) %>% 
    dplyr::bind_rows(.id = "arm")
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
death_rate(mod)
```

These "rates" are the individual probability of death per week. There may be the
possibility to compute similar things accounting for covariates but I need to do
some research on that. We can however verify that:

```{r}
0.02989321 / (1 - 0.02989321) / (0.07742014 / (1 - 0.07742014))
```

And here the probability ratio is

```{r}
0.02989321 / 0.07742014
```

## Adding covariables

The only covariable that seems to make sense to include is the age of the
chicken:

```{r}
(mod <- glm(cbind(suc, fai) ~ week + arm, binomial, viparc2))
```

```{r}
anova(mod, test = "LRT")
```

Alternatively, this can be modeled with a GAM:

```{r}
(mod <- mgcv::gam(cbind(suc, fai) ~ s(week) + arm, binomial, viparc2, method = "REML"))
```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

## A pipeline

As done for the prophylactic study, let's define the generic and methods
`get_outputs()`:

```{r}
get_outputs <- function (x, ...) {
  UseMethod("get_outputs", x)
}
```

for the generic and

```{r}
get_outputs.glm <- function(x) {
  conf_int <- confint(x)
  c(n    = nrow(x$model),
    or   = tail(coef(x), 1),
    p    = tail(anova(x, test = "LRT")$`Pr(>Chi)`, 1),
    ci   = conf_int[nrow(conf_int), ])
}
```

for the GLM method and 

```{r}
get_outputs.gam <- function(x, level = .95) {
  summ <- summary(x)
  conf_int <- mgcv.helper::confint.gam(x, level = level)
  c(n    = nrow(x$model),
    or   = unname(tail(summ$p.coef, 1)),
    p    = unname(tail(summ$p.pv, 1)),
    ci   = unlist(conf_int[nrow(conf_int), 5:6]))
}
```

for the GAM method. Let's try them:

```{r}
viparc2 %>% 
  glm(cbind(suc, fai) ~ week + arm, binomial, .) %>% 
  get_outputs()
```

and 

```{r}
viparc2 %>% 
  mgcv::gam(cbind(suc, fai) ~ s(week) + arm, binomial, ., method = "REML") %>% 
  get_outputs()
```

Let's make a batch:

```{r}
(batch <- expand.grid(cs = list(c("malaise", "diarrhoea"),
                                c("respiratory", "cns")),
                      am = list(c("colistin_use", "oxytetracycline_use"),
                                c("apramycin_use", "cefadroxil_use"))))
```

The corresponding data sets:

```{r}
datasets <- purrr::pmap(batch, prepare_data, df = viparc)
```

The models:

```{r}
glms <- t(sapply(datasets, function(x) get_outputs(glm(cbind(suc, fai) ~ week + arm, binomial, x))))
```

Or with a GAM:

```{r}
gams <- t(sapply(datasets, function(x) get_outputs(mgcv::gam(cbind(suc, fai) ~ s(week) + arm, binomial, x, method = "REML"))))
```

Let's write pipelines:

```{r}
pipeline_glm <- function(df, cs = NULL, am = NULL, gap = 1, x = 1) {
  require(magrittr)
  prepare_data(df, cs, am, gap, x) %$% 
    glm(cbind(suc, fai) ~ week + arm, binomial) %>% 
    get_outputs()
}
```

and:

```{r}
pipeline_gam <- function(df, cs = NULL, am = NULL, gap = 1, x = 1) {
  require(magrittr)
  prepare_data(df, cs, am, gap, x) %$% 
    mgcv::gam(cbind(suc, fai) ~ s(week) + arm, binomial, method = "REML") %>% 
    get_outputs()
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
pipeline_glm(viparc, cs_set, am_set)
```

and

```{r}
pipeline_gam(viparc, cs_set, am_set)
```


```{r}
a <- batch %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble() %>%
  assign("plan", ., 1) %>% # saving intermediate value
  c(FUN = pipeline_gam, ., MoreArgs = list(list(df = viparc)), SIMPLIFY = FALSE, mc.cores = 3) %>%
  do.call(parallel::mcmapply, .) %>% 
  do.call(dplyr::bind_rows, .) %>% 
  dplyr::bind_cols(plan, .)
```

Here is a full pipeline around GAM:

```{r}
run_plan <- function(df, cs = NULL, am = NULL, gap = 1, x = 1) {
  require(magrittr)
  
  var_names <- setdiff(names(df), c("arm", "farm", "flock", "week", "nb_chicken", "nb_chicken_sold", "chicken_disease_death", "chicken_sudden_death"))
  if (is.null(cs)) cs <- list(grep("_use$", var_names, value = TRUE, invert = TRUE))
  else if (! is.list(cs)) cs <- list(cs)
  if (is.null(am)) am <- list(grep("_use$", var_names, value = TRUE))
  else if (! is.list(am)) am <- list(am)
  
  expand.grid(cs = cs, am = am, gap = gap, x = x) %>%
    tibble::as_tibble() %>%
    assign("plan", ., 1) %>% # saving intermediate value
    c(FUN = purrr::safely(pipeline_gam), ., MoreArgs = list(list(df = df)), SIMPLIFY = FALSE, mc.cores = 4) %>%
    do.call(parallel::mcmapply, .) %>% 
    lapply(function(x) x$result) %>%
    assign("results", ., 1) %>% 
    sapply(is.null) %>% 
    `[<-`(results, ., list(c("n" = NA, "or" = NA, "p" = NA, "ci.2.5%" = NA, "ci.97.5%" = NA))) %>% 
    do.call(dplyr::bind_rows, .) %>% 
    dplyr::bind_cols(plan, .)
}
```

Let's try it:

```{r}
a <- run_plan(viparc, list(c("malaise", "diarrhoea"),
                           c("respiratory", "cns")),
                      list(c("colistin_use", "oxytetracycline_use"),
                           c("apramycin_use", "cefadroxil_use")))
```

The following function develops the list of clinical signs and / or
antimicrobials so that they can easily be read in the data frame:

```{r}
develop <- function(df, var = NULL) {
  names_df <- names(df)
  var_ref <- c("cs", "am")
  if (is.null(var)) var <- intersect(names_df, var_ref)
  stopifnot(var %in% names_df)
  stopifnot(var %in% var_ref)
  dplyr::mutate_at(df, var, ~ sapply(., paste, collapse = ", "))
}
```

The second one removes the columns that contain no variability:

```{r}
simplify <- function(df) {
  df[, sapply(df, function(x) length(unique(x))) > 1]
}
```

Let's try them:

```{r}
develop(a)
```

and

```{r}
simplify(a)
```

and

```{r}
simplify(develop(a))
```

### Generating tables

Let's download the data on the antimicrobials classes:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ab_classes <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/clires_data/master/data/antimicrobial_classes.csv", col_types = "cc")
ab_classes$antimicrobial <- paste0(ab_classes$antimicrobial, "_use")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
ab_classes <- readr::read_csv("../clires_data/data/antimicrobial_classes.csv", col_types = "cc")
ab_classes$antimicrobial <- paste0(ab_classes$antimicrobial, "_use")
```

It looks like this:

```{r}
ab_classes
```

Takes 15':

```{r eval = FALSE}
system.time(
tmp <- run_plan(df = viparc,
                cs = as.list(setdiff(grep("_use$", names(viparc), value = TRUE, invert = TRUE),
                                     c("farm", "flock", "week", "nb_chicken", "nb_chicken_sold",
                                       "chicken_disease_death", "chicken_sudden_death"))),
                am = split(ab_classes$antimicrobial, ab_classes$class),
                gap = 0:2,
                x = 1:3) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(cs = unlist(cs),
                am = names(am)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(clinical_signs = cs,
                class = am)
)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
saveRDS(tmp, "therapeutic.rds")
```
